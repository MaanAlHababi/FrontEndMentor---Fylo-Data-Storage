## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. How to position, and resize background images.
2. What the background-attachment is for.
```css
body {
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
```


### Continued development

1. Aligning elements using display:flex, and relevant attributes.
2. Positioning elements.
